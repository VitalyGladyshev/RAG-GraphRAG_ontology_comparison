Расскажите всё о I14 и его отношениях в Attempto Controlled English.,"## Analysis of i14

Based on the provided ACE axioms, here's a comprehensive description of i14 and its relationships:

**1. What is i14?**

i14 is a `shape_definition_representation`. This means it represents a definition of a shape, likely within a knowledge representation system.

**2. Properties and Values:**

i14 has two properties defined:

*   **`property_definition_representation_has_definition`**:  The value of this property is `i16`. This indicates that i14 *defines* something represented by i16.  We don't know what i16 *is* from these axioms, only that i14 defines it.
*   **`property_definition_representation_has_used_representation`**: The value of this property is `i15`. This indicates that i14 *uses* a representation denoted by i15 in its definition. Again, we don't know what i15 *is* from these axioms, only that it's used by i14.

**3. Relationships with other objects:**

*   **Relationship with i16:** i14 *defines* i16.  This is a defining relationship - i14 provides the definition for whatever i16 represents.
*   **Relationship with i15:** i14 *uses* i15. This suggests i15 is a component or resource utilized in the definition provided by i14.  It could be a geometric primitive, a coordinate system, or another representation.

**1. What is i61?**

`i61` is a `length_measure_with_unit`.  It's specifically a component representing a length measurement that *includes* a unit.

**2. Properties and Values of i61:**

*   **Type:** `length_measure_with_unit`
*   **Value Component:** `i61_value_component` (This represents the numerical value of the length measurement).
*   **Unit Component:** `i17` (This represents the unit associated with the length measurement).
*   **Conversion Factor:** `i61` *is* a `conversion_based_unit`, meaning it has a `conversion_factor` (though the value of the conversion factor isn't specified in these axioms).

**3. Relationships with other objects:**

*   **`i61_value_component`:** `i61` *has* a `value_component` which *is* `i61_value_component`.  `i61_value_component` itself is a `length_measure`. This indicates that `i61`'s overall value is determined by `i61_value_component`.
*   **`i17`:** `i61` *has* a `unit_component` which *is* `i17`. This means `i17` defines the unit of measurement for `i61`.
*   **`conversion_based_unit`:** `i61` *is a* `conversion_based_unit`. This implies that `i61` is defined by a conversion factor relative to some base unit.  The axiom `conversion_based_unit_has_conversion_factor i61` confirms that `i61` *has* a `conversion_factor`.



**In summary:** `i61` represents a length measurement expressed with a unit. It's composed of a numerical value (`i61_value_component`) and a unit (`i17`), and it's defined as a conversion-based unit, meaning its value is derived from a conversion factor.

Here's a detailed description of `i63` and its relationships, based on the provided ACE axioms:

**1. What is i63?**

`i63` is a **conversion_based_unit**, which is a specific type of **named_unit** and also a **length_unit**.  Essentially, it represents a unit of length that is defined by a conversion factor.

**2. Properties of i63:**

*   **Name:** `i63` has a name, which is `i63_name`.
*   **Conversion Factor:** `i63` has a conversion factor with a value of `i61`.
*   **Type:** It is a length unit.

**3. Relationships with other objects:**

*   **i63_name:** `i63_name` is a **label** that serves as the name for the unit `i63`.
*   **i61:** `i61` represents the conversion factor used to define `i63`.  The axiom states `i63 conversion_based_unit_has_conversion_factor i61`, meaning `i61` is the value that determines how `i63` relates to a base unit.
*   **i64:** `i63` is used as a unit component in a measurement represented by `i64`. The axiom `i64 measure_with_unit_has_unit_component i63` indicates that `i64` is a measurement *using* the unit `i63`.

*   **Has Source:** I77's source is `i77_source`.
*   **Has Assigned Document:** I77 is associated with document `i73`.
*   **Has Items:** I77 has a set of items called `i77_items`.

**Relationships with other objects:**

*   **i77_source (label):** `i77_source` is the source of the document reference `i77`. This indicates `i77_source` provides identifying information or origin details for `i77`.
*   **i73 (document):** `i73` is the document that `i77` references or is assigned to.
*   **i77_items (set_of_document_reference_item):** `i77_items` is a collection of `document_reference_item` objects that are part of `i77`.  `i77_items` *has content* `i70`.
*   **i70 (content):** `i70` is the content associated with the set of items `i77_items`.
*   **i78 (role_association):** `i77` is associated with `i78` as an item *with a role*. This suggests `i78` defines a role or function that `i77` fulfills within a larger context.



In summary, I77 is a specific type of document reference that points to another document (i73), has a defined source (i77_source), and is composed of a set of items (i77_items) with associated content (i70).

## Comprehensive Description of i78

Here's a detailed description of i78 based on the provided ACE axioms:

**1. Object Type/Class:**

i78 is a `role_association`. This defines its fundamental category.

**2. Properties and Values:**

i78 doesn't have any directly assigned properties *other* than its type. Its characteristics are defined through its relationships (see below).

**3. Relationships with Other Objects:**

i78 participates in two key relationships:

*   **`i78 role_association_has_role i79`**:  i78 *has a role* which is represented by the object i79. This means i79 defines *what* role is associated within this association.
*   **`i78 role_association_has_item_with_role i77`**: i78 *has an item with a role* which is represented by the object i77. This indicates that i77 is the item to which the role (i79) is being applied within the context of i78.

**4. Overall Explanation:**

In essence, i78 represents an association between an item (i77) and a role (i79). It acts as a connector, stating that the item i77 *has* the role i79.  The `role_association` object itself doesn't *have* a value for the role; it *defines* the association *of* a role to an item.



**In Attempto Controlled English:**

i78 is a role association. It has a role, namely i79. It also has an item with a role, namely i77. Therefore, i78 associates i77 with i79.",I78,3,"i78 is a role_association.

## Comprehensive Description of i79

Here's a detailed description of i79, based on the provided Attempto Controlled English axioms:

**1. What is i79?**

i79 is an **object_role**. This means it represents a role that an object can play or a function it can fulfill within a system or model.

**2. Properties of i79:**

*   **Name:** i79 has a name, which is `i79_name`. The axiom `i79 object_role_has_name i79_name` explicitly states this association.  We know `i79_name` is a `label`, but the *value* of that label (what the name actually *is*) isn't provided in these axioms.

**3. Relationships with other objects:**

*   **Association with i78:** i79 is related to another object, `i78`, through a `role_association_has_role` relationship. Specifically, `i78 role_association_has_role i79`. This indicates that `i79` is a role *associated with* `i78`.  `i78` is likely a role association, but its specific type isn't defined in these axioms.

**In summary:**

i79 is an object role identified by the label `i79_name`. It is associated with the object `i78` as part of a role association.  Further axioms would be needed to understand the specific function of i79 and the nature of its relationship with i78.",I79,4,"i79 is an object_role.

## Comprehensive Description of i130

Here's a detailed description of i130, based on the provided Attempto Controlled English (ACE) axioms:

**1. Object Type/Class:**

i130 is a `context_dependent_shape_representation`. This means it represents a shape, but its representation is dependent on a specific context.

**2. Properties and Values:**

The axioms don't directly state properties *of* i130 beyond its type. However, they define relationships *from* i130 to other objects, which effectively act as properties defining its role within the knowledge base. These are:

*   **`context_dependent_shape_representation_has_represented_product_relation`**:  This relation links i130 to i129.  We can interpret this as ""i130 represents a relation to product i129"".
*   **`context_dependent_shape_representation_has_representation_relation`**: This relation links i130 to i131. We can interpret this as ""i130 has a representation relation to i131"".

**3. Relationships with Other Objects:**

*   **i129:** i130 *represents* a relation to i129.  We don’t know what i129 *is* from these axioms, only that it's the target of the representation relation.
*   **i131:** i130 *has a representation relation* to i131.  Again, we don’t know what i131 *is*, only that it is related to i130 through a representation.

**4. Summary in ACE:**

i130 is a context\_dependent\_shape\_representation. 
i130 represents a relation to i129.
i130 has a representation relation to i131.



In essence, i130 acts as a link between a shape representation and two other entities: a product (i129) and another representation (i131). The exact nature of these relationships would require further axioms to clarify.",I130,3,"i130 is a context_dependent_shape_representation.

Расскажите всё о I131 и его отношениях в Attempto Controlled English.,"Okay, let's break down everything about I131 based on the provided ACE axioms.

**1. What is I131?**

I131 is a **shape_representation_relationship**. More broadly, it is also a **representation_relationship** and a **representation_relationship_with_transformation**. This means it describes how two representations relate to each other, and that this relationship involves some kind of transformation.

**2. Properties and Values of I131:**

*   **Name:** I131 has a name, which is `i131_name`.  `i131_name` is a `label`.

*   **Represents 1:** I131 relates to representation `i106` as its first representation (`rep_1`).
*   **Represents 2:** I131 relates to representation `i15` as its second representation (`rep_2`).
*   **Transformation Operator:** I131 utilizes a transformation operator, which is `i132`.

**3. Relationships with Other Objects:**

*   **Relationship to i106:** I131 *has* `i106` as its first representation (`rep_1`).  This suggests `i106` is being related to another representation *through* I131.
*   **Relationship to i15:** I131 *has* `i15` as its second representation (`rep_2`).  Similar to `i106`, `i15` is being related to another representation through I131.
*   **Relationship to i130:** I130 (a `context_dependent_shape_representation`) *has* I131 as its `representation_relation`. This means I131 defines a relationship *for* the context-dependent shape representation `i130`.
*   **Relationship to i132:** I131 *has* `i132` as its `transformation_operator`. This indicates that `i132` is the function or process used to transform one representation into the other within the relationship defined by I131.
*   **Relationship to i131_name:** I131 *has* `i131_name` as its name.
*   **Relationship to i131_description:** I131 *has* `i131_description` as its description.



In essence, I131 defines a specific relationship between two representations (i106 and i15), likely involving a transformation (specified by i132), and is used within the context of a context-dependent shape representation (i130).

## Comprehensive Description of I147

Here's a detailed description of object I147, based on the provided ACE axioms:

**1. Object Type/Class:**

I147 is a `shape_definition_representation`. This means it represents a definition of a shape, likely in a formal or computational way.

**2. Properties and Values:**

*   **`property_definition_representation_has_definition`**:  I147 *has* a definition, and that definition is represented by object I151.
*   **`property_definition_representation_has_used_representation`**: I147 *uses* a representation, and that representation is object I146.

**3. Relationships with Other Objects:**

*   **Relationship with I151:** I147 is directly related to I151 through the `property_definition_representation_has_definition` property. I151 *is the definition* that I147 represents.  We don't know what *type* of object I151 is from these axioms, only that it *is* a definition.
*   **Relationship with I146:** I147 is directly related to I146 through the `property_definition_representation_has_used_representation` property. I146 is a representation *used by* I147. Again, we don't know the specific type of I146, only that it serves as a representation utilized by I147.

**In summary:** I147 is a representation of a shape definition. It *defines* something (I151) and *uses* another representation (I146) in doing so. The exact nature of the definition and the used representation are not specified by these axioms, but their existence and relationship to I147 are clearly established.",I147,3,"i147 property_definition_representation_has_definition i151.
